# Open Source Quantum Gates
I like Quantum Computers so I created quantum gate(s)

QAND Gate:

Q0 and Q1 are what you check to see if they're the same and output Q2 if so.

I created the Quantum AND Gate because I wanted to see if I could create a Quantum Gate Schematic
without help from anyone or the internet plus I was bored.

Invert Polarity (Gate):

Created to make the QAND Gate even work

# Warning
That I'm still testing the gates and that these gates might have some problems with them.
Please don't use them unless you know what your doing, I would at least learn more about
everything shown in the gates.
